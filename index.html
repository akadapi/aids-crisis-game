You attend your first ACT UP meeting—a group of direct action protestors. You're nervous. One leader suggests a bold protest at the FDA to demand faster drug approval. It could get media attention, but also lead to arrests.\n\nDo you join the protest or focus on writing op-eds and raising awareness in safer ways?",
